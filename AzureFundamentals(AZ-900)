Module 1
1. Cloud computing
   Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet.
   Computing services are:
   a. Virtual machines
   b. Storage
   c. Databases
   d. Networking
   e. Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI)
   Cloud computing = Compute power + Storage
   Only pay for the resources used.
   Don’t have to wait to build a new physical datacenter.

2. Shared responsibility model
   Responsibilities are shared between the cloud provider and the consumer
   a. Cloud provider responsibilities
      i) Physical security
     ii) Power
    iii) Cooling
     iv) Network connectivity
  b. Consumer responsibilities
     i) Data and information stored in the cloud
    ii) Access security, meaning you only give access to those who need it

    Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) - Consumer responsibility
    Platform as a service (PaaS) - Evenly distributes responsibility between the cloud provider and the consumer
    Software as a service (SaaS) - Cloud provider responsibility

3. Cloud modules
   The deployment type of cloud resources
   The three main cloud models are: 
   i) Private
  ii) Public
 iii) Hybrid

    Private cloud: 
     A private cloud is the natural evolution from a corporate datacenter.
     It’s a cloud (delivering IT services over the internet) that’s used by a single entity. 
     Private cloud provides much greater control for the company and its IT department. 
     However, it also comes with greater cost and fewer of the benefits of a public cloud deployment. 
     Finally, a private cloud may be hosted from your 
     a. on site datacenter - Your company owns and manages the servers and infrastructure(On your premises).
     b. Can be hosted in a dedicated datacenter offsite - The infrastructure is located outside your company premises, but still used only by your company.
     c. A third party that has dedicated that datacenter to your company(Azure).
   
    Public cloud
     A public cloud is built, controlled, and maintained by a third-party cloud provider. 
     With a public cloud, anyone that wants to purchase cloud services can access and use resources.

   Hybrid cloud
     Uses both public and private clouds in an inter-connected environment
     Hybrid cloud can be used to provide an extra layer of security. 
     Users can flexibly choose which services to keep in public cloud and which to deploy to their private cloud infrastructure.

  Multi-cloud
     Use multiple public cloud providers. 
     Maybe you use different features from different cloud providers. 
     Or maybe you started your cloud journey with one provider and are in the process of migrating to a different provider. 
     Regardless, in a multi-cloud environment you deal with two (or more) public cloud providers and manage resources and security in both environments.

Azure Arc
   Azure Arc is a set of technologies that helps manage your cloud environment. 
   Azure Arc can help manage your cloud environment whether
   a. It's a public cloud solely on Azure
   b. A private cloud in your datacenter
   c. A hybrid configuration
   d. Even a multi-cloud environment running on multiple cloud providers at once.

Azure VMware Solution
What if you’re already established with VMware in a private cloud environment but want to migrate to a public or hybrid cloud? 
Azure VMware Solution lets you run your VMware workloads in Azure with seamless integration and scalability.

What is VMWare? Provides the software that runs on a physical server to host multiple VM's. 
                It allows you to create and run multiple virtual machines (VMs) on that server.
                Physical Server Has real hardware: CPU, RAM, and physical storage (like SSDs or HDDs).
                
                A physical server usually has multi-core CPUs (e.g., 16 cores or more).
                VMware lets you divide those cores into virtual CPUs (vCPUs).
                Each VM gets a certain number of vCPUs, which are scheduled to run on the physical cores.
                So, a server with 16 cores could run:
                              8 VMs with 2 vCPUs each
                              Or 16 VMs with 1 vCPU each
                              Or even more, depending on workload and scheduling
               
               Storage and Databases
               Each VM gets virtual storage (a virtual hard disk), which is stored on the server’s physical disk or shared storage.
               You can install databases inside VMs just like you would on a physical computer.
               Think of the physical server as a building, VMware as the architect, VMs as apartments, and the database as a tenant storing things in their apartment. The space they use is part of the building’s total capacity.

Consumption-based model
IT infrastructure models has two types of expenses to consider
a. Capital expenditure (CapEx) 
b. Operational expenditure (OpEx)

CapEx - One-time, up-front expenditure to purchase or secure tangible resources. 
        A new building, repaving the parking lot, building a datacenter, or buying a company vehicle.
OpEx  - Spending money on services or products over time(Eg: monthly). 
        Renting a convention center, leasing a company vehicle, or signing up for cloud services are all examples of OpEx.

Cloud computing falls under OpEx because cloud computing operates on a consumption-based model. 
You pay for the IT resources you use. 
If you don’t use any IT resources this month, you don’t pay for any IT resources.

This consumption-based model has many benefits, including:

1. No upfront costs.
2. No need to purchase and manage costly infrastructure that users might not use to its fullest potential.
3. The ability to pay for more resources when they're needed.
4. The ability to stop paying for resources that are no longer needed.

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet by using a pay-as-you-go pricing model. You typically pay only for the cloud services you use, which helps you:

1. Plan and manage your operating costs.
2. Run your infrastructure more efficiently.
3. Scale as your business needs change.

Module 2
Benefits of using cloud services

1. Benefits of High availability(uptime) and scalability(handle demand) in the cloud
a. High availability
   SLA - Service Level Agreement - The agreement between the service provider(Azure) and customer
   Azure SLA - Represented as % related to the application availablility. 
            Up time - How mcuh % of time will the service be available.
            Down time - How mcuh % of time is the service not available. Credit(money) will be given to consumer if the down time is breached.
   High SLA = High cost
   SLA in azure depends on the services - Like 99%, 99.95%, 99.99%
b. Scalability
   Ability to adjust resources to meet demand.
   If you suddenly experience peak traffic and your systems are overwhelmed, the ability to scale means you can add more resources to better handle the increased demand.
   Cloud is a consumption-based model, you only pay for what you use so you aren't overpaying for services.
   If demand drops off, you can reduce your resources and thereby reduce your costs.

   Feature	              Vertical Scaling	                Horizontal Scaling
   Scaling Method	        Add more power to one machine	    Add more machines
   Example	              Upgrade CPU/RAM	                   Add more servers
   Complexity	           Low	                               High
   Scalability Limit	     Yes	                               No (more flexible)
   Fault Tolerance	     Low	                               High

2. Benefits of reliability and predictability in the cloud
   Reliability
   Reliability is the ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function. 
   It's also one of the pillars of the Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework.

   Cloud with a decentralized design, enables 
   a. To have resources deployed in regions around the world
   b. With this global scale, even if one region has a catastrophic event other regions are still up and running. 
   c.  i) You can design your applications to automatically take advantage of this increased reliability. 
      ii) In some cases, your cloud environment itself will automatically shift to a different region for you, 
          with no action needed on your part.

   Predictability
   Predictability can be focused on 
   1. Performance predictability 
   2. Cost predictability.

   1. Performance
      a. Focuses on predicting the resources needed
      b. Cloud concepts that support performance predictability
          i) Autoscaling
         ii) Load balancing
        iii) High availability
   
   2. Cost
      Predicting the cost of the cloud spend.
      Below Tools help to get an estimate of potential cloud spend 
      a. Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) 
      b. Pricing Calculator 

      1. Track your resource use in real time, monitor resources to ensure that you’re using them in the most efficient way
      2. Apply data analytics to find patterns and trends that help better plan resource deployments. 
      3. By operating in the cloud and using cloud analytics and information, you can predict future costs and adjust your resources as needed

  3. Benefits of security and governance in the cloud
     Ensure that all your deployed resources meet corporate standards and government regulatory requirements.
     You can update all your deployed resources to new standards as standards change.
     Cloud-based auditing helps flag any resource that’s out of compliance with your corporate standards and provides mitigation strategies. 
     Depending on your operating model, software patches and updates may also automatically be applied, which helps with both governance and security.

     Security
     a. Find a cloud solution that matches your security needs
        Model	You Manage	                 Provider Manages	           Security Control
        IaaS	OS, patches, software	     Hardware, virtualization	     Maximum
        PaaS	App code	                    OS, runtime, patches	        Moderate
        SaaS	Data, user access	           Everything else(Eg:Gmail)	  Minimal
     b. The cloud is intended as an over-the-internet delivery of IT resources, 
        cloud providers are typically well suited to handle things like distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, 
        making your network more robust and secure.

 4. Benefits of manageability in the cloud
    There are two types
    1. Management of the cloud - Managing your cloud resources(Scale resource, 
                                                               Monitor the helath and automatically replace failing resources, 
                                                               Receive automatic alerts)
    2. Management in the cloud - How? - Web portal, Using command line interface, APIs, PowerShell

Module 3

Infrastructure as a Service
1. FLexible-Provides you the maximum amount of control for your cloud resources.
   
   Cloud provider responsibility - Hardware, Network connectivity (to the internet), and physical security
   Consumer responsibility - Everything else(operating system installation, configuration, and maintenance; network configuration; database and storage configuration)
   Example: Lift-and-shift migration - On-premise to cloud
            Testing and development -  You can start up or shut down the different environments rapidly
   
Platform as a Service
1. Middle ground between renting space in a datacenter (infrastructure as a service) and paying for a complete and deployed solution (software as a service).
   Consumer don't have to worry about the licensing or patching for operating systems and databases.

   Cloud provider responsibility - Physical infrastructure, physical security, and connection to the internet.
                                   Maintain the operating systems, middleware, development tools, and business intelligence services
   Consumer responsibility - Application building, Information and data, Devices, Accounts and identities

   Depending on the configuration, you or the cloud provider may be responsible for 
   1. Networking settings and connectivity within your cloud environment
   2. Network and application security
   3. The directory infrastructure.

   Example: Developers create applications using built-in software components.
            Analytics or business intelligence - Predicting outcomes to improve forecasting, product design decisions, investment returns, and other business decisions

Software as a Service
1. Renting or using a fully developed application(Email, financial software, messaging applications, and connectivity software)
   Example: Email and messaging, Business productivity applications, Finance and expense tracking.

             Core architectural components of Azure 

Azure accounts
  Azure account -> Subscription(one or more) -> Resource groups -> Resources
  Single Azure account for your business and separate subscriptions for development, marketing, and sales departments

  Azure free account: https://azure.microsoft.com/free
  Azure free student account: https://azure.microsoft.com/free/students/

  Microsoft Learn sandbox: Creates a temporary subscription that's added to your Azure account. 
  This temporary subscription allows you to create Azure resources during a Learn module. 
  Learn automatically cleans up the temporary resources for you after you've completed the module.

 Lear sandbox can be used using the below methods or use Azure portal(https://portal.azure.com/learn.docs.microsoft.com)
 1. PowerShell CLI
 2. BASH CLI
 3. Azure CLI interactive mode

Physical infrastructure
* Azure starts with datacenters.
* Azure has datacenters around the world.

Datacenters are grouped into 
1. Azure Regions 
2. Azure Availability Zones

Regions: Chennai
* Region is a geographical area on the planet
* Contains at least one, but potentially multiple datacenters(networked together with a low-latency network)

Availability Zones: Annanagar, T.Nagar, Velacherry
* Physically separate datacenters within an Azure region.
* If one zone goes down, the other continues working. 
* Availability zones are connected through high-speed, private fiber-optic networks.
* Availability zones are primarily for VMs, managed disks, load balancers, and SQL databases.

 Azure services that support availability zones fall into three categories:
 1. Zonal services: You pin the resource to a specific zone (for example, VMs, managed disks, IP addresses).
 2. Zone-redundant services: The platform replicates automatically across zones
 3. Non-regional services: Services are always available from Azure

Region pairs(300 miles away)
* Most Azure regions are paired with another region within the same geography
* For example, if a region in a pair was affected by a natural disaster, services would automatically fail over to the other region in its region pair.
* EX: West US paired with East US and South-East Asia paired with East Asia

Sovereign Regions
* Sovereign regions are instances of Azure that are isolated from the main instance of Azure.
* Sovereign region are used for compliance or legal purposes.

Azure management infrastructure
1. Resources 
2. Resource groups
3. Subscriptions
4. Accounts

1. Resources:
   * Resource is the basic building block of Azure
   * Anything you create, provision, deploy, etc. is a resource
   * Virtual Machines (VMs), virtual networks, databases, cognitive services, etc. are all considered resources within Azure.

2. Resource groups:
   * Groupings of resources.
   * A single resource can only be in one resource group at a time.
   * Resource groups can't be nested, meaning you can’t put resource group B inside of resource group A.
   * When you apply an action to a resource group, that action will apply to all the resources within the resource group.
   * If you delete a resource group, all the resources will be deleted.
   * If you grant or deny access to a resource group, you’ve granted or denied access to all the resources within the resource group.

3. Azure subscriptions:
   * Subscriptions are a unit of 
      a. Management
      b. Billing
      c. Scale
    * A subscription provides you with authenticated and authorized access to Azure products and services. 
    * It also allows you to provision resources. (When you provision a virtual machine, you're allocating CPU, memory, disk space, and installing an operating system)
    * An account can have multiple subscriptions


      You only need one subscription to use Azure.
      But you can have multiple subscriptions to organize things better.
      Why Multiple Subscriptions?

      1. To separate billing for different teams or projects.
      2. To control access differently for different departments or environments.

      Two Types of Boundaries in Azure Subscriptions
      1. Billing Boundary
      * Determines how you're charged.
      * Each subscription gets its own invoice.
      * Example: One subscription for Dev, another for Prod, each with its own budget.
      2. Access Control Boundary
      * Determines who can do what.
      * You can apply different policies to different subscriptions.
      * Example: HR department has access to one subscription, Finance to another.

      Example, you can create:
      One subscription for Dev (with limited access and lower cost).
      One for Prod (with stricter access and higher performance).
      One for Finance (read-only access to billing data).

   Azure management groups
     * Resources are gathered into resource groups, and resource groups are gathered into subscriptions.
     * Azure management groups provide a level of scope above subscriptions.(root)
     * All subscriptions within a management group automatically inherit the conditions applied to the management group
     * Management group -> Subscriptions -> Resource groups -> Resources

     * Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) 

      Important facts about management groups:
      * 10,000 management groups can be supported in a single directory.
      * A management group tree can support up to six levels of depth. This limit doesn't include the root level or the subscription level.
      * Each management group and subscription can support only one parent.

      Management Group: Production
      │
      ├── Policy: Allow VMs only in US West
      │
      ├── Subscription A
      │   └── VM (Policy enforced)
      │
      ├── Subscription B
      │   └── VM (Policy enforced)
      │
      └── Azure RBAC: Contributor role assigned to user@company.com
          └── Inherited by all subscriptions and resources


Module 2
Azure compute and networking services

   a. Compute options
      1. Virtual machines
      2. Containers
      3. Azure functions

   b. Networking features
      1. Azure virtual networks
      2. Azure DNS
      3. Azure ExpressRoute

Compute options
1. Azure virtual machines
   * You can create and use VMs in the cloud. 
   * VMs provide infrastructure as a service (IaaS)

VMs are an ideal choice when you need:
   * Total control over the operating system (OS) -       Test your application on Ubuntu 22.04, Windows Server 2019, and CentOS 7.
   * The ability to run custom software -                 Java application that depends on an old version of Java (e.g., JDK 6) and a specific version of Tomcat.
   * To use custom hosting configurations -               A web server (Apache), An app server (Spring Boot), A database (PostgreSQL) - Configure each component on separate VMs, set up custom networking between them, and even simulate firewalls or load balancers
As an IaaS offering, you still need to configure, update, and maintain the software that runs on the VM.

Image :  
      An image is a template used to create a VM and may already include an OS and other software, 
      like development tools or web hosting environments.

Scale VMs in Azure
1. Run single VMs for testing, development, or minor tasks.
2. Group VMs together to provide high availability, scalability, and redundancy.
   Types: 
      a. Scale sets
      b. Availability sets

Virtual machine scale sets
1. Create and manage a group of identical, load-balanced VMs
2. Scale sets allow you to centrally manage, configure, and update a large number of VMs in minutes. 
3. The number of VM instances can automatically increase or decrease in response to demand, or you can set it to scale based on a defined schedule. 
4. VM Scale sets also automatically deploy a load balancer to make sure that your resources are being used efficiently. 
5. VM scale sets, you can build large-scale services for areas such as compute, big data, and container workloads.

Availability sets
1. Tool to help you build a more resilient, highly available environment
2. Ensure that VMs 
   a. Stagger updates 
   b. Has power and network connectivity,

Update domain: 
* The update domain groups VMs that can be rebooted at the same time. 
* This setup allows you to apply updates while knowing that only one update domain grouping is offline at a time. 
* All of the machines in one update domain update. An update group going through the update process is given a 30-minute time to recover before maintenance on the next update domain starts.

Fault domain: 
* The fault domain groups your VMs by common power source and network switch. 
* By default, an availability set splits your VMs across up to three fault domains. 
* This helps protect against a physical power or networking failure by having VMs in different fault domains (thus being connected to different power and networking resources).

Examples of when to use VMs
1. During testing and development
2. When running applications in the cloud  
3. When extending your datacenter to the cloud(On-premis+Cloud)
4. During disaster recovery

2. Azure Virtual Desktop
Another type of virtual machine is the Azure Virtual Desktop.
   * Azure Virtual Desktop is a virtualization service that runs on the cloud
   * Use a cloud-hosted version of Windows from any location
   * Azure Virtual Desktop works across devices and operating systems, and works with apps that you can use to access remote desktops/most modern browsers.
Enhance security
   1. Enable multifactor authentication to secure user sign-ins
   2. Assigning granular role-based access controls (RBACs) to users

3.Azure containers
