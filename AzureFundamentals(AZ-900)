Module 1
1. Cloud computing
   Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet.
   Computing services are:
   a. Virtual machines
   b. Storage
   c. Databases
   d. Networking
   e. Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI)
   Cloud computing = Compute power + Storage
   Only pay for the resources used.
   Don’t have to wait to build a new physical datacenter.

2. Shared responsibility model
   Responsibilities are shared between the cloud provider and the consumer
   a. Cloud provider responsibilities
      i) Physical security
     ii) Power
    iii) Cooling
     iv) Network connectivity
  b. Consumer responsibilities
     i) Data and information stored in the cloud
    ii) Access security, meaning you only give access to those who need it

    Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) - Consumer responsibility
    Platform as a service (PaaS) - Evenly distributes responsibility between the cloud provider and the consumer
    Software as a service (SaaS) - Cloud provider responsibility

3. Cloud modules
   The deployment type of cloud resources
   The three main cloud models are: 
   i) Private
  ii) Public
 iii) Hybrid

    Private cloud: 
     A private cloud is the natural evolution from a corporate datacenter.
     It’s a cloud (delivering IT services over the internet) that’s used by a single entity. 
     Private cloud provides much greater control for the company and its IT department. 
     However, it also comes with greater cost and fewer of the benefits of a public cloud deployment. 
     Finally, a private cloud may be hosted from your 
     a. on site datacenter - Your company owns and manages the servers and infrastructure(On your premises).
     b. Can be hosted in a dedicated datacenter offsite - The infrastructure is located outside your company premises, but still used only by your company.
     c. A third party that has dedicated that datacenter to your company(Azure).
   
    Public cloud
     A public cloud is built, controlled, and maintained by a third-party cloud provider. 
     With a public cloud, anyone that wants to purchase cloud services can access and use resources.

   Hybrid cloud
     Uses both public and private clouds in an inter-connected environment
     Hybrid cloud can be used to provide an extra layer of security. 
     Users can flexibly choose which services to keep in public cloud and which to deploy to their private cloud infrastructure.

  Multi-cloud
     Use multiple public cloud providers. 
     Maybe you use different features from different cloud providers. 
     Or maybe you started your cloud journey with one provider and are in the process of migrating to a different provider. 
     Regardless, in a multi-cloud environment you deal with two (or more) public cloud providers and manage resources and security in both environments.

Azure Arc
   Azure Arc is a set of technologies that helps manage your cloud environment. 
   Azure Arc can help manage your cloud environment whether
   a. It's a public cloud solely on Azure
   b. A private cloud in your datacenter
   c. A hybrid configuration
   d. Even a multi-cloud environment running on multiple cloud providers at once.

Azure VMware Solution
What if you’re already established with VMware in a private cloud environment but want to migrate to a public or hybrid cloud? 
Azure VMware Solution lets you run your VMware workloads in Azure with seamless integration and scalability.

What is VMWare? Provides the software that runs on a physical server to host multiple VM's. 
                It allows you to create and run multiple virtual machines (VMs) on that server.
                Physical Server Has real hardware: CPU, RAM, and physical storage (like SSDs or HDDs).
                
                A physical server usually has multi-core CPUs (e.g., 16 cores or more).
                VMware lets you divide those cores into virtual CPUs (vCPUs).
                Each VM gets a certain number of vCPUs, which are scheduled to run on the physical cores.
                So, a server with 16 cores could run:
                              8 VMs with 2 vCPUs each
                              Or 16 VMs with 1 vCPU each
                              Or even more, depending on workload and scheduling
               
               Storage and Databases
               Each VM gets virtual storage (a virtual hard disk), which is stored on the server’s physical disk or shared storage.
               You can install databases inside VMs just like you would on a physical computer.
               Think of the physical server as a building, VMware as the architect, VMs as apartments, and the database as a tenant storing things in their apartment. The space they use is part of the building’s total capacity.

Consumption-based model
IT infrastructure models has two types of expenses to consider
a. Capital expenditure (CapEx) 
b. Operational expenditure (OpEx)

CapEx - One-time, up-front expenditure to purchase or secure tangible resources. 
        A new building, repaving the parking lot, building a datacenter, or buying a company vehicle.
OpEx  - Spending money on services or products over time(Eg: monthly). 
        Renting a convention center, leasing a company vehicle, or signing up for cloud services are all examples of OpEx.

Cloud computing falls under OpEx because cloud computing operates on a consumption-based model. 
You pay for the IT resources you use. 
If you don’t use any IT resources this month, you don’t pay for any IT resources.

This consumption-based model has many benefits, including:

1. No upfront costs.
2. No need to purchase and manage costly infrastructure that users might not use to its fullest potential.
3. The ability to pay for more resources when they're needed.
4. The ability to stop paying for resources that are no longer needed.

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet by using a pay-as-you-go pricing model. You typically pay only for the cloud services you use, which helps you:

1. Plan and manage your operating costs.
2. Run your infrastructure more efficiently.
3. Scale as your business needs change.

Module 2
Benefits of using cloud services

1. Benefits of High availability(uptime) and scalability(handle demand) in the cloud
a. High availability
   SLA - Service Level Agreement - The agreement between the service provider(Azure) and customer
   Azure SLA - Represented as % related to the application availablility. 
            Up time - How mcuh % of time will the service be available.
            Down time - How mcuh % of time is the service not available. Credit(money) will be given to consumer if the down time is breached.
   High SLA = High cost
   SLA in azure depends on the services - Like 99%, 99.95%, 99.99%
b. Scalability
   Ability to adjust resources to meet demand.
   If you suddenly experience peak traffic and your systems are overwhelmed, the ability to scale means you can add more resources to better handle the increased demand.
   Cloud is a consumption-based model, you only pay for what you use so you aren't overpaying for services.
   If demand drops off, you can reduce your resources and thereby reduce your costs.

   Scalability Limit	     Yes	                               No (more flexible)
   Fault Tolerance	     Low	                               High

2. Benefits of reliability and predictability in the cloud
   Reliability
   Reliability is the ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function. 
   It's also one of the pillars of the Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework.

   Cloud with a decentralized design, enables 
   a. To have resources deployed in regions around the world
   b. With this global scale, even if one region has a catastrophic event other regions are still up and running. 
   c.  i) You can design your applications to automatically take advantage of this increased reliability. 
      ii) In some cases, your cloud environment itself will automatically shift to a different region for you, 
          with no action needed on your part.

   Predictability
   Predictability can be focused on 
   1. Performance predictability 
   2. Cost predictability.

   1. Performance
      a. Focuses on predicting the resources needed
      b. Cloud concepts that support performance predictability
          i) Autoscaling
         ii) Load balancing
        iii) High availability
   
   2. Cost
      Predicting the cost of the cloud spend.
      Below Tools help to get an estimate of potential cloud spend 
      a. Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) 
      b. Pricing Calculator 

      1. Track your resource use in real time, monitor resources to ensure that you’re using them in the most efficient way
      2. Apply data analytics to find patterns and trends that help better plan resource deployments. 
      3. By operating in the cloud and using cloud analytics and information, you can predict future costs and adjust your resources as needed

  3. Benefits of security and governance in the cloud
     Ensure that all your deployed resources meet corporate standards and government regulatory requirements.
     You can update all your deployed resources to new standards as standards change.
     Cloud-based auditing helps flag any resource that’s out of compliance with your corporate standards and provides mitigation strategies. 
     Depending on your operating model, software patches and updates may also automatically be applied, which helps with both governance and security.

     Security
     a. Find a cloud solution that matches your security needs
        Model	You Manage	                 Provider Manages	           Security Control
        IaaS	OS, patches, software	     Hardware, virtualization	     Maximum
        PaaS	App code	                    OS, runtime, patches	        Moderate
        SaaS	Data, user access	           Everything else(Eg:Gmail)	  Minimal
     b. The cloud is intended as an over-the-internet delivery of IT resources, 
        cloud providers are typically well suited to handle things like distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, 
        making your network more robust and secure.
