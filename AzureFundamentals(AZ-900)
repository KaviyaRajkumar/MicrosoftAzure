Module 1
1. Cloud computing
   Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet.
   Computing services are:
   a. Virtual machines
   b. Storage
   c. Databases
   d. Networking
   e. Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI)
   Cloud computing = Compute power + Storage
   Only pay for the resources used.
   Don’t have to wait to build a new physical datacenter.

2. Shared responsibility model
   Responsibilities are shared between the cloud provider and the consumer
   a. Cloud provider responsibilities
      i) Physical security
     ii) Power
    iii) Cooling
     iv) Network connectivity
  b. Consumer responsibilities
     i) Data and information stored in the cloud
    ii) Access security, meaning you only give access to those who need it

    Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) - Consumer responsibility
    Platform as a service (PaaS) - Evenly distributes responsibility between the cloud provider and the consumer
    Software as a service (SaaS) - Cloud provider responsibility

3. Cloud modules
   The deployment type of cloud resources
   The three main cloud models are: 
   i) Private
  ii) Public
 iii) Hybrid

    Private cloud: 
     A private cloud is the natural evolution from a corporate datacenter.
     It’s a cloud (delivering IT services over the internet) that’s used by a single entity. 
     Private cloud provides much greater control for the company and its IT department. 
     However, it also comes with greater cost and fewer of the benefits of a public cloud deployment. 
     Finally, a private cloud may be hosted from your 
     a. on site datacenter - Your company owns and manages the servers and infrastructure(On your premises).
     b. Can be hosted in a dedicated datacenter offsite - The infrastructure is located outside your company premises, but still used only by your company.
     c. A third party that has dedicated that datacenter to your company(Azure).
   
    Public cloud
     A public cloud is built, controlled, and maintained by a third-party cloud provider. 
     With a public cloud, anyone that wants to purchase cloud services can access and use resources.

   Hybrid cloud
     Uses both public and private clouds in an inter-connected environment
     Hybrid cloud can be used to provide an extra layer of security. 
     Users can flexibly choose which services to keep in public cloud and which to deploy to their private cloud infrastructure.

  Multi-cloud
     Use multiple public cloud providers. 
     Maybe you use different features from different cloud providers. 
     Or maybe you started your cloud journey with one provider and are in the process of migrating to a different provider. 
     Regardless, in a multi-cloud environment you deal with two (or more) public cloud providers and manage resources and security in both environments.

Azure Arc
   Azure Arc is a set of technologies that helps manage your cloud environment. 
   Azure Arc can help manage your cloud environment whether
   a. It's a public cloud solely on Azure
   b. A private cloud in your datacenter
   c. A hybrid configuration
   d. Even a multi-cloud environment running on multiple cloud providers at once.

Azure VMware Solution
What if you’re already established with VMware in a private cloud environment but want to migrate to a public or hybrid cloud? 
Azure VMware Solution lets you run your VMware workloads in Azure with seamless integration and scalability.

What is VMWare? Provides the software that runs on a physical server to host multiple VM's. 
                It allows you to create and run multiple virtual machines (VMs) on that server.
                Physical Server Has real hardware: CPU, RAM, and physical storage (like SSDs or HDDs).
                
                A physical server usually has multi-core CPUs (e.g., 16 cores or more).
                VMware lets you divide those cores into virtual CPUs (vCPUs).
                Each VM gets a certain number of vCPUs, which are scheduled to run on the physical cores.
                So, a server with 16 cores could run:
                              8 VMs with 2 vCPUs each
                              Or 16 VMs with 1 vCPU each
                              Or even more, depending on workload and scheduling
               
               Storage and Databases
               Each VM gets virtual storage (a virtual hard disk), which is stored on the server’s physical disk or shared storage.
               You can install databases inside VMs just like you would on a physical computer.
               Think of the physical server as a building, VMware as the architect, VMs as apartments, and the database as a tenant storing things in their apartment. The space they use is part of the building’s total capacity.

Consumption-based model
IT infrastructure models has two types of expenses to consider
a. Capital expenditure (CapEx) 
b. Operational expenditure (OpEx)

CapEx - One-time, up-front expenditure to purchase or secure tangible resources. 
        A new building, repaving the parking lot, building a datacenter, or buying a company vehicle.
OpEx  - Spending money on services or products over time(Eg: monthly). 
        Renting a convention center, leasing a company vehicle, or signing up for cloud services are all examples of OpEx.

Cloud computing falls under OpEx because cloud computing operates on a consumption-based model. 
You pay for the IT resources you use. 
If you don’t use any IT resources this month, you don’t pay for any IT resources.

This consumption-based model has many benefits, including:

1. No upfront costs.
2. No need to purchase and manage costly infrastructure that users might not use to its fullest potential.
3. The ability to pay for more resources when they're needed.
4. The ability to stop paying for resources that are no longer needed.

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet by using a pay-as-you-go pricing model. You typically pay only for the cloud services you use, which helps you:

1. Plan and manage your operating costs.
2. Run your infrastructure more efficiently.
3. Scale as your business needs change.

Module 2
Benefits of using cloud services

1. High availability(uptime) and scalability(handle demand) in the cloud
High availability
SLA - Service Level Agreement - The agreement between the service provider(Azure) and customer
Azure SLA - Represented as % related to the application availablility. 
            Up time - How mcuh % of time will the service be available.
            Down time - How mcuh % of time is the service not available. Credit(money) will be given to consumer if the down time is breached.
High SLA = High cost
SLA in azure depends on the services - Like 99%, 99.95%, 99.99%
