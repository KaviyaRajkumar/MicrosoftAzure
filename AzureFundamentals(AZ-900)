1. Cloud computing
   Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet.
   Computing services are:
   a. Virtual machines
   b. Storage
   c. Databases
   d. Networking
   e. Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI)
   Cloud computing = Compute power + Storage
   Only pay for the resources used.
   Donâ€™t have to wait to build a new physical datacenter.

2. Shared responsibility model
   Responsibilities are shared between the cloud provider and the consumer
   a. Cloud provide responsibilities
      i) Physical security
     ii) Power
    iii) Cooling
     iv) Network connectivity
  b. Consumer responsibilities
     i) Data and information stored in the cloud
    ii) Access security, meaning you only give access to those who need it

    Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) - Consumer responsibility
    Platform as a service (PaaS) - Evenly distributes responsibility between the cloud provider and the consumer
    Software as a service (SaaS) - Cloud provider responsibility
